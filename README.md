## Responsive, Modern & Built With Modular, Reusable Components

This project utilizes React-Redux, CSS3, ES6, & The FLUX Pattern to Build a "Beyond Responsive" Redesign of the CNBC Homepage.

I created this project in preparation for an interview on November 4th, 2019 for a Front End Developer position at the Englewood Cliffs CNBC Location.

Prototyped in Figma. Bootstrapped with Create-React-App.
